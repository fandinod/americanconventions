	<h1 class="display-5">Introduction to the American Conventions project</h1>
	<p>Conventions have become a mainstay of modern fandom, enabling fans to directly connect with the producers of popular culture. This project focuses on 1990 to 2000, the heady pre-internet days where conventions offered a liminal space for fans to interact with like-minded individuals over shared interests. 
		Certain conventions of the convention evolved over time, borrowing from the structure of the science fiction and trade meetings already extant in the United States and introducing new concepts springing from the particular needs and interests of anime fandom. This included a bend towards the exploration of the culture of Japan and a heavier emphasis on costume play, or cosplay.
	<br>
	<p>Although the first acknowledged mainstream anime convention in the United States is A-Kon in 1990, smaller fan-run events took place throughout the 1980s, including Yamato-con in 1983.
	   In the digital age of online resellers and streaming video, it may be difficult to realize that a short 30 years ago conventions were often the most viable means of buying merchandise from Japan or watching
	   a brand new (or even not so new) anime series. The video room and dealer's room were often the only means for fans to acquire any form of merchandise from their favorite series. 
	   Panels also. Interest in Japan was often connected to an interest in Japanese cultural products, so panels often included sessions on the basics of the Japanese language, food, clothing such as kimono, and art styles including calligraphy and ikebana.
	   Anime fandom was a relatively niche fandom in due to the difficulty of acquiring the product, the language barrier, and the need for specialized--and at first expensive--equipment in the form of a video cassette player.

<h1 class="display-5">Why Study Conventions</h1>

	<p>Popular culture is often conceived as disposable, often only rising to public attention when monetary value is attached to popular culture objects such as the recent interest in superhero comics. Yet the basis of modern fandom was built in the halls of early conventions. Like in the early internet, identities are negotiated, fans engaged with each other, knowledge exchanged, all under the banner of a imagined Japan. This process has not been chronicled or archived in a systematic manner.</p> 
	<p>The upswing in interest in Japan also coincided with the nadir of U.S. - Japan relations since the end of World War II. While programs such as Space Battleship Yamato (宇宙戦艦ヤマト) were
		gaining popularity in the United States, America and Japan were on a collision course.
		By the 1980s, the Japanese economic miracle had transformed the nation into the world’s second largest economy. The rise of Japan as an economic superpower transgressed upon traditional American imperatives of technological superiority and manufacturing prowess. For a moment in the 1980s Japan presented a vision of future modernity incompatible with American ideals of progress based on axes of whiteness and power.  Understanding the relationship between technology, nationalism and commodities exchange between the U.S. and Japan is critical to understanding how both nations progressed from adversaries to allies to rivals and then back to allies—all while failing to mutually understand the techno-nationalist aims of the two nations
The 1980s were highly uncertain years when a new post-modern, post-American order seemed to be on the horizon, led by a newly ascendant, futuristic Japan. The American response was marked by racial tensions as the U.S. was unable to reconcile the promise of American technology transforming a nation into a modern economic powerhouse that was the equal—if not better—of the United States with the stark reality of Japan achieving that mark. A deep anxiety struck the United States once Japan matched American technical prowess and economic ability in the 1980s, and the ensuing dialogue drew upon deeply racialized ideas and language drawn from World War II. Although the Japanese moment would pass for the United States, it would have a lasting impact on the depiction of Japan in popular culture, creating indelible stereotypes and patterns developed at the nadir of U.S. - Japan relations. The revival of World War II era racial concepts and the idea of a Japan as a dangerous technological powerhouse were melded together and ingrained in American perceptions of Japan. This image of Japan has been exacerbated by Japan’s own efforts to use technology and popular culture in a new bid to and maintain relevancy in world affairs after the collapse of the bubble economy.

<p>George Lipsitz notes that contemporary social historians turn to popular culture to broaden the archive of available evidence. As Donald Lowe argues, history is not the past but rather a representation of the past.</p>
